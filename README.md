# Network_Scanner
This network scanner is a personal project for my cybersecurity studies. It helps me learn key networking skills by detecting active devices and scanning common ports on a local network. This tool demonstrates my coding abilities and understanding of network security concepts, making it ideal for school projects and practical learning.
